i don't fucking care...this is the sixth hour wrangling with the very fist assignment from an INTRO course
and I am just stuck on a for loop
a simple for loop
the maximum repeat is only 10000
and M2 macbook is heating up already
HOW???
and how it is that I am so stupid??????????????????
by the way the IDE finds no grammatical/syntax error aside from torturing me with unexptected indent
